## Who I am
Hello! I‚Äôm Gregory Hilbert, an aspiring IT professional with a unique blend of experience in business management, data analysis, and supporting IT operations while in non IT roles. My curiosity and excitement for solving problems have led me to develop a strong interest in information technology, especially in **network engineering** and **blue teaming**. I‚Äôm committed to gaining a more technical understanding of how networks operate, and how we can best configure those networks as I pursue my first official role in IT or Cybersecurity.

### Background
My first "real" job was at the age of 17 in a customer service related job. During my time at this job, I managed to impress a local pharmacy manager with my work ethic. This led to me taking a position at Walmart Pharmacy. My performance in the pharmacy eventually led to me being promoted to management, and most recently an asset protection position. Along the way, one thing has been constant. The use of technology. I have always been fascinated with how things work, and fixing them when they don't work. I had already began thinking about what I wanted next in my career, and in February of 2024 I decided to earn my Google Cybersecurity Certificate. After completing that course, it solidified the fact that I want to work in IT & Cybersecurity.

These projects showcase my practical experience and skills. These are my most recent projects:

### DHCP Server Configuration (November 2024) <span style="color:magenta;">[Project]</span>
- Configured a DHCP server with 2 different networks attached, utilizing static and dynamic IP addressing.
- Created rules to avoid IP address conflicts, while maintaining routability across the networks. 

### Cisco Network Configuration (November 2024) <span style="color:magenta;">[Project]</span>
- Configured a simple network using 4 PCs, 2 Cisco switches, and a Cisco router
- Established connectivity between the devices by configuring the router's gigabit Ethernet ports and manually assigning static IP addresses to the PCs
  
### Introduction to Cybersecurity Certificate Course (August 2024) <span style="color:green;">[Lab]</span>
 - Offensive security: Successfully hacked web applications, taking advantage of common security issues
 - Defensive security: Used digital forensics to defend against live cyber attacks, where time was of the essence

### Python: Identifying Unusual Login Patterns With the Use of Functions (March 2024) <span style="color:green;">[Lab]</span>
 - Used Python to help identify potentially malicious login activity, using a list containing the number of failed attempts that occurred each month
 - Established parameters in functions, indenting the logic underneath of them so they were properly stored in the function.
