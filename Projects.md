## Projects

### Random Password Generator 
 [View Report](Project PDFs/Password_Generator_Project.pdf)
 - Used Python to create a random password generator
 - Defined a function that generates a random password with customizable length, requiring at least one lowercase letter, uppercase letter, digit, and special character using the random and string modules
 - Ensured a guaranteed return message to the user even if the user typed something into the input box besides the number of characters they want their password to be

### SIEM Home Lab Setup
[View Report](Project PDFs/SIEMproject.pdf)
- Successfully set up a home lab with Elastic SIEM and a Kali VM
- Used the SIEM's interface to query and analyze events
- Developed a custom dashboard in Elastic SIEM to visualize security events, showcasing abilities in data analysis and pattern recognition
- Created alerting rules to detect and forward security events

### DHCP Server Configuration
[View Detailed Overview](Project PDFs/DHCPconfigurationProject.pdf)
- Configured a DHCP server with 2 different networks attached, utilizing static and dynamic IP addressing.
- Created rules to avoid IP address conflicts, while maintaining routability across the networks.

### Cisco Network Configuration 
[View Detailed Overview](Project PDFs/NetworkConfigurationProject.pdf) <!-- Consider changing wording from diagram to report depending on what I'm showcasing -->
   - Configured a simple network using 4 PCs, 2 Cisco switches, and a Cisco router
   - Established connectivity between the devices by configuring the router's gigabit ethernet ports and manually assigning static IP addresses to the PCs

## Labs

### Python 
   - **Identifying Unusual Login Patterns With the Use of Functions**
 [View .PY File](Misc Files/AnalyzingLoginAttemptsWithPython.py)
 - Used Python to help identify potentially malicious login activity
 - Utilized built-in functions to analyze monthly failed login attempts and created a function to compare daily login attempts to the userâ€™s average
 - Established parameters in functions, indenting the logic underneath of them so they were properly stored in the function

### TryHackMe
